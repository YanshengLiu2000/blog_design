    Finish the Kogan test question. Need learn more about the python threading things.
    Wokring in Cafe this afternoon, have steak this evening.
    Do nothing about leetcode.
    Modified templates. Though the template part still needs a lot of work.
    Going to start COMP6714 tomorrow. Hope it is not too hard.
