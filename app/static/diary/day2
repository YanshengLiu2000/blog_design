    Keep doing the DP questions in leetcode.
    Complete five more today. Feels good, at least i can have an idea when i meet the question.
    Learn SQLAlchemy.
    This is a little bit different from Flask-SQLAlchemy.
    In one word, it is better and has more functions than flask one.
    Should use MongoDB in the future. But in recent weeks, i believe it is a good time to review SQLite.
    Can not believe i have learnt PostgreSQL in my second semester!
